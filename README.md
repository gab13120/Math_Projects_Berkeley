# A Personal Math-to-Code Portfolio

This repository showcases a personal reconstruction of two full-score competitive math exams from France's most selective undergraduate economics track (ECS), reinterpreted through modern, rigorous, and executable Python notebooks.

## Why This Project?

During France’s elite competitive exams, I earned top scores for analytical reasoning under pressure.  
But I wanted to take it one step further.

- What if I could bring that rigor into the computational world?  
- What if I could simulate, visualize, and verify every convergence, distribution, and transformation using Python?

This project is my answer. It’s a bridge between pen-and-paper intuition and executable logic.  
It is a way to demonstrate my comfort and my enthusiasm with advanced mathematics through clarity, structure, and code.

Not a technical masterpiece. But a deliberate one.

## Who I Am

I’m currently in my Master 1 in Finance at EDHEC Business School (Nice campus).  
Before that, I spent 3 years in the French Classe Prépa ECS, and earned admission to every top business school except one.  
I quickly rose to a top level in mathematics, which became both a strength and a passion.

My goal is to join the Berkeley MFE during my M2 year.  
This project is one of the ways I’m preparing for that next step.

## Included Projects

### 1. HEC Mathematics II 2023 – Probability & Random Walks
- Score: 16.5/20
- Focus: Law of large numbers, stopping times, combinatorics
- Almost fully simulated using Python

### 2. EM Lyon Mathematics 2023 – Series, Distributions, Linear Forms
- Score: 20/20
- Focus: Logarithmic series, density transformation, bilinear algebra
- Verified step-by-step using symbolic and numerical tools

## Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter notebooks
- NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, sympy

## A Note to the Berkeley Committee

This repository is not a résumé.  
It’s a quiet statement of intent.

It shows:
- My ability to work through advanced math problems
- My comfort with translating theory into clean, executable logic
- My desire to be evaluated not just by credentials, but by what I can actually build
