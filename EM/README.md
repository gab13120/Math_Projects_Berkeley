# EM Lyon Mathematics 2023 – Annotated Competitive Proof

This repository presents a full reconstruction of the 2023 EM Lyon mathematics exam, graded 20/20. The content is translated into a pedagogical and computational format tailored to the expectations of top quantitative programs like Berkeley MFE.

## Context

- Format: 4-hour competitive written exam
- Type: Rigorous deterministic and probabilistic analysis
- Topics covered:
  - Series and logarithmic approximation
  - Convergence of discrete and continuous distributions
  - Linear algebra and duality
  - Scalar product structures

## Structure

- `PythonEM` - Python notebooks replicating mathematical results
- `EMpaper` – Full handwritten exam paper (20 pages, scanned, done in 4 hours in exam conditions)
- `subjectEM` – Official PDF subject from the national exam (in French)


## Purpose

This notebook-based reconstruction is part of an academic portfolio designed to demonstrate rigorous mathematical training to Berkeley MFE admission Committee.
