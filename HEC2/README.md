# HEC Mathematics 2023 – Annotated Competitive Proof (ECS)

This repository presents a complete solution of the 2023 HEC Mathematics 2 exam from the ECS track, awarded a 16.5/20. The work has been restructured into a pedagogical and code-integrated format, aligned with expectations from programs such as the Berkeley Master of Financial Engineering (MFE).

## Context

- Format: 4-hour competitive entrance exam
- Type: Rigorous proof-based analysis under time constraints
- Topics covered:
  - Real analysis and asymptotic convergence
  - Probability theory (law of large numbers, CLT)
  - Arcsin distribution and simulation
  - Estimators and confidence intervals

## Structure

- Python notebooks replicating mathematical results
- `HEC2paper/` – Full handwritten exam paper (20 pages, scanned, done in 4 hours in exam conditions)
- `subjectHEC2/` – Official PDF subject from the national exam (in French)

## Highlights

- Full derivation of arcsin distribution and density
- CLT-based confidence intervals in simulation
- Simulated convergence of estimators
- Real-world quant applications and visualization

## Purpose

This project demonstrates mathematical maturity and clarity in competitive conditions. It is intended as part of an academic portfolio for quantitative finance and engineering programs such as Berkeley MFE.
