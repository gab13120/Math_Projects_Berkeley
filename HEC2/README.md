# HEC Mathematics 2023 – Annotated Competitive Proof (ECS)

This repository presents a solution of the 2023 HEC Mathematics 2 exam from the ECS track, restructured into a pedagogical and code-integrated format.

## Context

- Format: 4-hour competitive entrance exam
- Type: Rigorous proof-based analysis under time constraints
- Topics covered:
  - Real analysis and asymptotic convergence
  - Probability theory (law of large numbers, CLT)
  - Arcsin distribution and simulation
  - Estimators and confidence intervals

## Structure

- `PythonHEC2` - Python notebooks replicating mathematical results
- `HEC2paper` – Full handwritten exam paper (20 pages, scanned, done in 4 hours in exam conditions)
- `subjectHEC2` – Official PDF subject from the national exam (in French)


## Purpose

This project demonstrates mathematical maturity and clarity in competitive conditions. It is intended as part of an academic portfolio for Berkeley MFE application.
